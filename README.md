# TheShopMaster

## What this project is about

$TheShopMaster$ is a web application that informs you, the user, of where which item is on sale in the german supermarkets.

The plan is to include the following shops in the app:
- ALDI
- Lidl
- REWE
- Penny
- Edeka
- Norma
- Netto
- Kaufland

We are still in development, so you can follow the progress of this application being built by us. 

## Who we are

We are a group of students studying Cyber Security on the Corporate State University Baden-W√ºrttemberg (DHBW) in Mannheim. 

The initial idea of the project was crafted, while out in the shops and wondering, if the items on sale are really the cheapest possible price.

# Project Status Update ‚è∏Ô∏è

üî¥ **Attention** üî¥

It is with a heavy heart that we announce the temporary pause of our project. Despite our team's unwavering dedication and hard work, we have encountered a significant roadblock: **the inability to secure permissions from individual supermarkets**. This setback directly impacts our ability to proceed as planned, leading us to this difficult decision.

## What This Means
- **Development Freeze**: All current development efforts will be put on hold until further notice.
- **Open Communication**: Our lines remain open. We're here to answer your questions and keep you informed about any changes or updates.

## Looking Ahead
This is not the end. We are actively seeking solutions and exploring alternatives to overcome this challenge. Our commitment to realizing the project's goals remains strong, and we are hopeful for a positive resolution in the future.

Stay tuned for updates, and again, thank you for your understanding and patience during this time.

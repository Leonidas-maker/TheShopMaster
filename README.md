# TheShopMaster

## What this project is about

$TheShopMaster$ is a web application that informs you, the user, of where which item is on sale in the german supermarkets.

The plan is to include the following shops in the app:
- ALDI
- Lidl
- REWE
- Penny
- Edeka
- Norma
- Netto
- Kaufland

We are still in development, so you can follow the progress of this application being built by us. 

## Who we are

We are a group of students studying Cyber Security on the Corporate State University Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (DHBW) in Mannheim. 

The initial idea of the project was crafted, while out in the shops and wondering, if the items on sale are really the cheapest possible price.
